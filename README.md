# ScanTheCan - Built at Microsoft Hacks 2017 (Won 3rd Place)

ScanTheCan is a native iOS application (written in Swift) that eases the process of managing receipts for both, the users and the companies. The application has two kinds of login, one for the users and one for the companies. Once logged in, the users can view all their receipts and also a unique QR Code. The company, once logged in, can either view all their products in stock or start scanning products - once scanned all the products, the company employee can send the receipt to any user by scanning their QR Code. I find the idea pretty cool but since there isn't a lot of scope in market (as it will be almost impossible to convince giant grocery stores to let a third party application manage their data and secrets), I decided to drop the idea after the hackathon.

Here are a few screenshots of the application: <br />
